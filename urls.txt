A text file named urls.txt including:
Public Url to GitHub repository (not private) [URL01]
Public URL for your S3 Bucket (aka, your green candidate front-end) [URL02]
Note: The services should be up and running while the reviewer evaluates your project. 
If you use Udacity provided AWS account, the EC2 instance will shut down (not terminate) automatically after the 
session ends at every 4 hours. Therefore, you can consider rerunning the CircleCI pipeline just before the submission 
for provisioning the new AWS resources and provide the working URL02.
